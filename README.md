## What to Do

In this challenge, your task is **single-category 3D point cloud instance segmentation**.

For each scene point cloud, predict a point-wise instance label:

$$
\hat y_i \in \{0,1,2,\dots\}
$$

- `0`: background
- `1,2,...`: predicted object instances (the order of instance IDs is arbitrary)

Ground truth is also provided as point-wise instance labels with the same convention.

This means:
- the key task is to correctly separate background and multiple target instances,
- matching between predictions and ground truth is permutation-invariant (handled in the evaluator).

We provide the dataset format and a fixed evaluator. Your job is to improve the model in `training/model.py`.

**Model interface constraint (must keep):**
- `initialize_model(ckpt_path, device, ...) -> your_model: torch.nn.Module`: load model from checkpoint path
- `run_inference(your_model, features, ...) -> [B, N]`: return point-wise instance labels

You may freely change the model architecture, training strategy, and `model.py`, as long as the interface above remains compatible. You can also generate additional codes, but note that your code will be evaluated using the provided evaluator, simply by replacing `evaluate.py`, so you should not modify the evaluator.

**Important Notes**

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY! Any violation of the rules, or failure to properly cite any existing code, models, or papers used in the project in your write-up, will result in a zero score.

### What You CANNOT Do

- ❌ **DO NOT** use any pretrained network.
- ❌ **DO NOT** exceed the total model parameter limit (50M).
- ❌ **DO NOT** use any extra dataset for training other than the provided training split (`train`, `val`) and reference objects (`sample.glb`).
- ❌ **DO NOT** modify the provided `evaluate.py` in the official submission.
- ❌ **DO NOT** use any CUDA version other than the provided one (default: 12.4).
- ❌ **DO NOT** exceed the main inference loop time limit (300 seconds).
- ❌ **DO NOT** exceed the VRAM limit (24GB).

### What You CAN Do

- ✅ **Modify `model.py`** to implement your own model.
- ✅ **Implement your own dataset loader** to load your own dataset using multiscan dataset and reference object.
- ✅ **Implement your own training pipeline** to train your model.
- ✅ **Create new files**: Add any additional implementation files you need
- ✅ **Use open-source implementations**: As long as they are clearly mentioned and cited in your write-up

### Additional Notes

- You may use only the packages listed above. If your implementation requires an additional library, please upload to the Slack channel with the library name and a brief justification. The TAs will review each request and approve or reject it. Only approved libraries may be used.
- Predicted instance IDs are valid only in `1..100`. Any predicted ID greater than `100` is remapped to background (`0`) before scoring.

## Dataset and Base Code

You are required to use the **MultiScan benchmark dataset** for training and evaluation.

<!-- ![Dataset](multiscan.png) -->

Please follow the instructions in the original GitHub repository and download the benchmark dataset:

[MultiScan Dataset README](https://github.com/smartscenes/multiscan/blob/main/dataset/README.md)

- Object Instance Segmentation

**Please note that downloading the dataset may take some time, so we recommend preparing it as early as possible.**

We also provide an additional Google Drive link with reference 3D objects in `.glb` format:
[Link]({https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1guo68JlVkeqAzX7nR3DOfOB6SfhL3XC9?usp=sharing})

## Generation Pipeline for Test Data

For each output scene:
- a random number of objects is inserted (`min=1`, `max=5`)
- mesh placement is attempted with multiple scale ratios (range: `0.025` to `0.2` of the scene diagonal)
- an object may be placed on top of another object, with partial overhang allowed

Once the object is placed, the point cloud is extracted with the following augmentations:
- anisotropic scaling: each of the x, y, and z axes is independently scaled within the range `(0.5, 1.5)`
- affine transform: rotation around the x,y,z-axis in the range `(-180, 180)`
- color map jittering

## Test Data Format

Each generated scenes are saved as `.npy` files with the following format:

Saved dictionary keys:
- `xyz`: `float32`, shape `(N, 3)`
- `rgb`: `uint8`, shape `(N, 3)`
- `normal`: `float32`, shape `(N, 3)`
- `is_mesh`: `bool`, shape `(N,)`
- `instance_labels`: `int32`, shape `(N,)` (`0` for background, positive IDs for inserted instances)

We will also provide example test datas. 

## Evaluation

We will evaluate the generated test data using two metrics: 1) instance segmentation and 2) semantic foreground segmentation quality.

1) Instance evaluation uses Hungarian matching on point-level IoU between predicted and GT instances.

- For each scene:
  - Convert point-wise instance labels (`id > 0`) to binary instance masks.
  - Compute the pairwise IoU matrix between predicted and GT masks.
  - Run Hungarian matching (1-to-1 assignment) using cost `1 - IoU`.
  - For each IoU threshold `\tau`, count:
    - `TP_\tau`: matched pairs with `IoU \ge \tau`
    - `FP_\tau`: predicted instances not counted as TP
    - `FN_\tau`: GT instances not counted as TP

- For each threshold `\tau`, compute:
    $$
    F1_{\tau} = \frac{2 TP_{\tau}}{2 TP_{\tau} + FP_{\tau} + FN_{\tau}}
    $$
  where `TP_\tau`, `FP_\tau`, and `FN_\tau` are aggregated over all scenes.

- We report:
  - `F1@25` = $F1_{\tau=0.25}$
  - `F1@95` = $F1_{\tau=0.95}$
  - `F1@50:90:05` = $\frac{1}{9}\sum_{\tau \in \{0.50,0.55,\dots,0.90\}} F1_\tau$

- Final instance score:
  $$
  \text{Instance Score} = 0.25 \times \text{F1@25} + 0.5 \times \text{F1@50:90:05} + 0.25 \times \text{F1@95}
  $$

2) Semantic foreground quality is measured using `semantic_object_mIoU`:
$$
\text{Semantic Score}
=
\frac{\sum_i \mathbf{1}[y_{\mathrm{pred},i} > 0 \land y_{\mathrm{gt},i} > 0]}
{\sum_i \mathbf{1}[y_{\mathrm{pred},i} > 0 \lor y_{\mathrm{gt},i} > 0]}
$$

More details about the evaluation metrics are provided in `evaluate.py`.

- The TAs provide scores below computed using their own implementation as reference values (the code will not be released). You are expected to match or exceed these reference values.
- Additionally, to help everyone gauge progress, there will be a [Mid-Term Evaluation](#mid-term-evaluation-submission-optional) where teams can submit intermediate results.
- **Final grading will be determined relative to the best score achieved for each task.** Specifically, the score for each task is computed as follows:

$$
\mathrm{Score} = \max\left(\cfrac{\mathrm{Your\,Score}}{\mathrm{Highest\,Score}} \times 8, 0\right)
$$

- If your score equals the highest score, you receive 8 points for that task.

- Bonus credits for each task:
  - **Mid-Term Evaluation Bonus**: Every team that outperforms the TA’s score in the mid-term evaluation receives +1.0 point for that task.
  - **Winner Bonus**: If your team achieves the highest score for a task, you receive +1.0 point for that task.

- In total, the 3D Point Cloud Segmentation Challenge is worth a maximum of 20 points.

## Mid-Term Evaluation Submission (Optional)

The purpose of the mid-term evaluation is to help teams gauge their progress relative to others. **Participation is optional**, but the top-k teams for each task that outperform the TAs’ scores will receive **bonus credit** toward the final grade.

| Metric | TA Score |
|---|---:|
| Instance Score | `0.1254` |
| Semantic Score | `0.4835` |

- **What to submit**
  1. **Self-contained source code**
      - Your submission must include the complete codebase necessary to run end-to-end in the TA environment.
      - The TAs will run your code in their environment without additional modifications.
      - For consistent evaluation, `evaluate.py` will be replaced with the official version.
  2. **A model checkpoint** (and an optional config file)

- **Grading Procedure**
  - The TAs will run your submitted code in their Python environment.
  - The scores measured by the TAs will be published on the leaderboard.
  - Submissions that fail to run in the TA environment will be marked as failed on the leaderboard.
  - Among the submissions that outperform the TAs’ scores, the top-k teams will receive bonus credit.

## Final Submission

- **What to submit**:
  1. **Self-contained source code**
  2. **A model checkpoint** (and an optional config file)
  3. **A 2-page write-up**
      - No template is provided.
      - Maximum of two A4 pages, excluding references.
      - All of the following must be included:
          - **Technical details**: A one-paragraph description of your implementation, including the architecture design, hyperparameters, and other relevant details.
          - **Training details**: Training logs (e.g., training loss curves) and the total training time.
          - **Qualitative evidence**: Approximately four rendered sample images with segmentation results.
          - **Citations**: All external code and papers used must be properly cited.
      - Missing any of these items will result in a penalty.
      - If the write-up exceeds two pages, any content beyond the second page will be ignored, which may result in missing required items.

## Grading

**There are no late days. Submit on time.**  
**Late submission**: Zero score.  
**Missing any required item in the final submission (qualitative results, code/checkpoint, or write-up)**: Zero score.  
**Missing items in the write-up**: 10% penalty for each.
